ideas:
    change kifu to record moves as a tree. undo button branches tree, ability to mobe board to anywhere in the kifu.

unfinished:
    sideboard
        sort piecelist
    kifu?
        undo moves
    pawn
        can't drop into mate

issues:
    lag when piece hits check. O(n^4) loop.
    occasional null error. can't reproduce
    possible to move while in check?? always for player 1
