ideas:
    change kifu to record moves as a tree. undo button branches tree, ability to mobe board to anywhere in the kifu.

unfinished:
    sideboard
        sort piecelist
    kifu?
        undo moves (connect button)
    pawn
        can't drop into mate
issues:
    lag when piece hits check. O(n^4) loop.
    fix encapsulation for Board and Piece.
    possible weirdness with pieces going to zero on promotion
    pieces moving but waiting to rotate on promotion??
